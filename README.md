================

Improvemt of "boston-cab dot com" website.
This is a responsive website with 3 different break points:- desktop, tablets and mobile.
It uses browser sniffing technique to detect the device type.
For mobile devices, I have developed a different version using jquery mobile components.
For desktop and tablets, I have made the website responsive using CSS3 Media Queries.
